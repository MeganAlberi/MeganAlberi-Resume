        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Megan Alberi, I am a third-year college student, majoring in Psychology, with the hope of becoming a clinical psychologist or criminal psychologist. I first started my college experience at RCC where I graduated with my Associates in Psychology and transferred to UCR where I am pursuing my Bachelors in Psychology. In the past I have worked as an insta shopper for instacart and I have babysat. In high school, I was in a club called interact in which went out and would do acts of community service such as picking up trash, and I was also in Link Crew where I mentored a group of freshmen in my Junior and Senior years. At UCR I have joined the SHARP club in which we make PB&J sandwiches and health bags for the homeless individuals in our community. I graduated RCC with a 4.0 and am aiming for a high GPA at UCR. I have also just accepted an invitation to The National Society of Leadership and Success. I consider myself to be a hardworking and responsible individual that nevers allows myself to do less than my absolute best in everything, setting high standards for myself. Psychology is my major of choice because it is something I have always been very passionate about, not only can you learn so much about yourself and your own mind but you can help so many people live a good life, by helping them work through their mental issues and everyday struggles. I have personal experience with mental health issues which has led to me doing a lot of research on many areas of Psychology and having some good personal insight. I find it to be one of the most interesting things, to understand the human brain and the complexities of it, in order to have an idea of why people do what they do and what truly goes on in our minds. I plan on attending grad school when I graduate from UCR, and I am hoping to get involved in some research in Psychology on campus, specifically research in personality psychology as it is a class I am taking right now and it has really sparked my interest. My interest in Psychology began all the way back in high school when I did a passion project and started researching Psychology, leading me to take AP Psych my Junior year where I had the most amazing teacher who inspired me to pursue a career in it. My dream is criminal Psychology because that seems like the most fascinating field as I find it so interesting to understand why people do the horrendous things they do, and what really goes on in these peoplesâ€™ minds. I have already started talking to my Psychology professors this quarter about joining them in their research, which will hopefully give me some hands on experience and some knowledge on what working in the field is actually like. I am excited to continue working towards my goals and to become some form of a Psychologist.<br><br>
